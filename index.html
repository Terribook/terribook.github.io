<p>
Terribook was founded in the 5th grade classroom of CAS Mrs. Conley's class of 2012.
</p>


<p>
It all started out with a poster and sticky notes, but now its slowly progressing. 
</p>

<p>
Terribook can also be seen as a Kateri's twist of a social media network, 
</p>

<h3>
Ka<u>teri</u> and Face<u>book</u>.
</h3>
 
<p>
After the concept was thought out by Kateri, a poster was drawn, perhaps a 3x3 sq. ft. with the edges rounded by scissors and the skilled hands of 5th grade artist in the classroom.
<br>
It was themed such as this website, a clear sky blue with cartoonish white clouds.
